## Features

- **Screensaver Mode**  
  Double-click anywhere to toggle a minimal, idle-friendly display.

- **3D Interaction**  
  Click + drag (or swipe) to rotate the attractor in 3D space.

- **Multiple Systems**  
  **Lorenz**, **Halvorsen**, and other chaotic systems.  
  - Each system includes interactive presets and tunable parameters.

- **Real-Time**  
  Uses the **Runge-Kutta method** (4th order) to solve differential equations numericaly.

- **Retro Mode**  
  Pixelated, low-res visuals with a color scheme inspired by  
  *X-COM: Terror from the Deep*.
